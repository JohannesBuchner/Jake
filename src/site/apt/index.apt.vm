     Ever needed to work on an assignment with your classmates? Or share some documents with your co-workers on another continent? Maybe you just need a foolproof way of keeping your work on two computers in sync? Then Jake is for you.

 * <No storage server required>  

[images/features_noserver.png] no server

     Jake is a revolutionary new way of sharing files between people that doesn't require anything more than a Jabber instant messaging account (which you may even already have).

     Why use a central server that can crash and lose your files? Your team owns your data, and we pride ourselves in keeping it this way.

 * <Plays well with others>

     Windows user? Linux nerd? Mac fanboy? We've got you covered. Jake runs on all platforms you can think of. Well, except the iPhone. Unless Apple decides to donate six iPhones to us.

 * <Keep track of your projects>

     So the CIA won't read your grocery list. Or your WLAN-sniffing neighbor. Legal notice: Tinfoil hat not included.
  
 * <Not just free. Open.>  

[images/features_opensource.png] Open source

     Because we love open source software as much as you do. This allows you to customise Jake to your needs, or just take a peek if you're curious.
