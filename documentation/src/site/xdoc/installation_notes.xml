    	<p>
    		To run the application you need:
    		<ul>
    			<li>Java Runtime Environment JRE 5.0 or higher (The latest version of the JRE is usually installed on modern operating systems. Try running the application before installing a new java JRE), <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp"> download JRE</a></li>
    			<li>download the .jar file from this website (not available yet, You may find it in the repo)</li>
    			<li>You may run the application by entering "java -jar &lt;location of jake&gt;" in the shell or command prompt.</li>
    		</ul>
    	</p>

    		<p>
    			<i><b>There are so many different versions of the the JRE, I don't know which one to chose.</b></i>
    			<br />
    			To run this application you at least need the JRE version 5.0. Any higher version will do fine, also version 6.0. You may alternatively install the latest JDK (Java Development Kit) version since the JRE is part of the JDK. Unless you are a developer you might prefer the JRE, as the extra developers stuff won't be of interest for you.
